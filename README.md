# onlineshop

Mock online shop for the ACA Java class. Core functionality works.

Master currently in working form. Dev branch will have improvements but may not be completely functional

Missing features/future improvements:

Input validation/confirmation

No logging

Some null throws

Assumes DB already exists

Delivery service works, but requires valid lat&long points with no validation(there is a second api for this)

Delivery service should have delivery windows (am, pm/morning, afternoon, evening)

Remove orderlist package and add join functionality to orderdao
